# LearnEDAfunctions

This package includes special functions and datasets for a course on Exploratory Data Analysis based on John Tukey's EDA text.

# Installation

It can be installed from Jim Albert's Github site:

```
library(remotes)
install_github("bayesball/LearnEDAfunctions")
```

The only prerequisite packages are the dplyr and ggplot2 packages.

## Loading

The ```LearnEDAfunctions``` package is loaded by the library() function:

```{r}
library(LearnEDAfunctions)
```

# Other EDA Functions

Also there are several functions from other packages used in the EDA course.  One will need to install 
these packages to use this functions.

- stem.leaf() from the aplpack package
- rootogram() from the vcd package
